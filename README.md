# CountryNameFramework
Modders resource for country names in the video game "Hearts of Iron 4"
Steam workshop link: TBA

The default localisation files that are used for country names in HoI4 are an outright mess. No comments, no real order or sense to it. It is an absolute ball ache to work with (and whoever wrote it should be ashamed, and needs to do better).
The aim of this project is to rewrite these files, to make them somewhat reasonable to work with when making country name edit mods. Only planned to support english however should work for other languages too (maybe idk I haven't looked in those files)

The main changes to be implemented by this mod include
Sorting nations into an understandable order
Making nation entries formatted in a reasonable way
Adding code comments
